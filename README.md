# hi. welcome to my profile.
if you're from somewhere else: i don't really have serious projects, it's mostly random scripts and school assignments here. i put every single project here just because it's free cloud storage. half of the profile views is just me cause i'm a narcissist.

if you're an employer: please please please pretend i'm really really good at coding thank you.
